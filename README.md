# Report on the use of passive acoustic monitoring in Kluane National Park Reserve

Passive acoustic monitoring has proven to be a valuable tool for studying vocalizing species. Environmental sensors are becoming increasingly easy to program and can autonomously generate extensive data sets of the soundscape, becoming an invaluable resource for ecological integrity monitoring. Kluane National Park Reserve deployed autonomous recording units (ARUs) across 10 locations, participating in the national Prescribed Burn protocol initiated in 2023. ARUs detected a total of 16 species including birds and mammals. Sustained monitoring of these areas following prescribed burns, incorporating enhanced protocols for equipment functionality, as well as broader scope in recording and data collection, will optimize the effectiveness of the ongoing monitoring program. Future data collection can be facilitated by more advanced models and analyses.
